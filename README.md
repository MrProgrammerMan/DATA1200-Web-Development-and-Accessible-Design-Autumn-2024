# Matematisk Modellering og Datavitenskap – Ingeniør

This project is a comprehensive web page created for the course DATA1200 Web Development and Accessible Design at Oslo Metropolitan University. The course is a 5 ECTS credit course that focuses on web development and accessibility principles. The project was developed by a team of four dedicated students, and it showcases our learning and collaboration throughout the course.

## Project Overview

The web page provides detailed information about the Bachelor's program in Mathematical Modeling and Data Science at OsloMet. It includes sections on study information, other related studies, student stories, and more. The project emphasizes accessibility and adheres to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The web page is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Accessibility**: We focused on making the web page accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. This includes using semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and ensuring sufficient color contrast.
- **Creative Implementations**: Due to the course restriction on using JavaScript, we implemented some features creatively using only HTML and CSS. This includes interactive elements like the search bar and menu toggle.

## Learning Outcomes

Throughout this project, we gained valuable experience in:

- **Web Development**: We enhanced our skills in HTML and CSS, learning how to create a responsive and accessible web page.
- **Accessibility**: We learned the importance of accessibility in web design and how to implement it effectively.
- **Collaboration with Git**: Working as a team, we faced challenges such as merge conflicts and learned how to manage a collaborative project using Git.
